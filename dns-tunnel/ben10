Ben 10 is an American media franchise conceived by Man of Action and owned by The Cartoon Network, Inc. The franchise, mainly consisting of animated series produced by Cartoon Network Studios, revolves around a young boy named Ben Tennyson, who discovers the Omnitrix — a high-tech, extraterrestrial device shaped like a wristwatch. This remarkable gadget contains the DNA of various alien species, allowing Ben to transform into them at will. Initially, the Omnitrix features ten alien transformations, but over time, Ben gains the ability to unlock additional species.

The franchise has garnered considerable critical acclaim, securing three Emmy Awards. It encompasses five primary television series, three feature films, and numerous video games. It ranks as Cartoon Network's second longest existing franchise. Furthermore, Ben 10 has inspired a line of toys produced initially by Bandai for the franchise's first four series and later by Playmates Toys for the reboot. The Ben 10 franchise is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

On February 17, 2021, Cartoon Network announced three 44-minute specials slated for April 2021, titled Ben 10,010, Ben Gen 10, and Alien X-Tinction. These specials serve as both the series finale for the 2016 reboot and a crossover event involving the first four television series in the franchise.[1]

As of 2024, the five concluded series are split into two continuities: the classic continuity, including the original series and its sequels–Ben 10 (2005–2008), Ben 10: Alien Force (2008–2010), Ben 10: Ultimate Alien (2010–2012), and Ben 10: Omniverse (2012–2014), and the reboot continuity of Ben 10 (2016–2021), with its 2021 April specials serving as both the series finale for the 2016 reboot and a crossover event connecting both continuities. As of 2025, there are a total of 393 episodes.

As of 2020, there have been three animated films – Secret of the Omnitrix (2007), Destroy All Aliens (2012), Versus the Universe (2020) and two live-action films – Race Against Time (2007), Alien Swarm (2009) released in the franchise.

    Ben appeared as a parody of Benjamin Franklin on the show MAD, in an episode titled "Ben 10 Franklin". Franklin was flying his kite when he was struck by a lightning bolt, gaining the Omnitrix. He used Swampfire to sign the Declaration of Independence. He also used Humongousaur to defeat the British and smash down a junior high school bully's house in revenge. He used other aliens from Alien Force and Ultimate Alien, where they have his hair and glasses.
    Also in MAD, a reference to Alien Force was made with a parody of the movie Cowboys & Aliens, with many titles: "Cowboys & Alien Force", "Cowboys & Equestrians", and "Cowboys & Silly Bands". The reference was made at the beginning when Jake awakes with Ben on his side, but with Jake wearing Ben's pants and hat, with the Omnitrix on his wrist. He also used the Omnitrix to become an alien with the mix of Diamondhead, Chromastone, and Way Big to smash a cowboy.
    In the South Park episode "You're Getting Old", Cartman's mother mentions that Cartman gets upset when he does not get a present every time someone else gets a present at a party. One of the presents Cartman gets is a "Ben 10 Wrist Rocket".
    The Robot Chicken episode "Hurtled from a Helicopter into a Speeding Train" shows Ben on his 14th birthday party, where he complains about his gifts given by Azmuth.
    Ben 10 villains, such as the Enoch, Hex and Animo, make a brief cameo in The Secret Saturdays episode "Van Rook's Apprentice". References to Galvan Prime and Wildvine's species also appear in "Guess Who's Going to Be Dinner?" and "Eterno" respectively. Both references were made by the Secret Scientist Dr. Arthur Beeman, the UFOlogist for the series.
    In the Peep Show episode, "Man Jam", Jeremy jokingly refers to Ben, the boyfriend of a woman he admires, as "Ben 10" during a phone call to him.[4]
    Teenage Ben Tennyson appeared in The Official BBC Children in Need Medley in 2009.
    In the Jellystone! crossover special titled "Crisis on Infinite Mirths", 10-year-old Ben Tennyson uses the Omnitrix to transform into Stinkfly to fight Floral Rugg of The Hillbilly Bears.[5]

Bandai manufactured Ben 10 toys from the first four series,[13] while Playmates Toys has produced toys for the 2016 reboot.

Six construction sets were produced by Lego, depicting Spidermonkey, Humungousaur, Swampfire, Chromastone, Jet Ray, and Big Chill.[14]

The series received three McDonald's Happy Meal promotions internationally, as well as one in America in August 2011.[15] The toys are colored translucent figures of some Omnitrix/Ultimatrix aliens and their Ultimate forms, with a small photo of Ben inside. The Alien Force toys are four rings, each one is an alien (Goop, Jetray, Alien X, Chromastone) with features linked with their powers.

Developed by Jason Hall, Min G. Kuand and Heroic Age, the Ben 10 comic revolves around Ben's summer vacation with Gwen and their Grandpa Max, travelling in the Rust Bucket. The Ben 10: Alien Force comic revolves around Ben, with Gwen and a reformed Kevin, battling the Highbreed and the DNAliens.

Cartoon Network Action Pack was a 2006–2012 comic book series made by DC Comics which showcased Ben 10 alongside Samurai Jack, Codename: Kids Next Door, The Secret Saturdays, or Generator Rex. Some of the issues were connected with the franchise, while others are non-canon.

In February 2013, IDW Publishing announced a partnership with Cartoon Network to produce comics based on Cartoon Network properties. Ben 10 was one of the titles announced to be published.[16]

In July 2024, Dynamite Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Brands and Experiences announced new comic books featuring Ben 10.[17]
